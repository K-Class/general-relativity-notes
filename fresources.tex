Below is a list of resources that I used to compile these notes, plus ones that may help you if you choose to study further. All 
are highly recommended.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Apostol's Calculus, volumes I and II (single and multivariable, respectively)
\item 3Blue1Brown's Linear Algebra videos on YouTube
\item passcalculus.com's videos on Limits on YouTube
\item Doc Schuster's videos on calculus on YouTube
\item DrPhysicsA's videos on general relativity on YouTube
\item A Cartoon Guide to Calculus by Larry Gonick
\item Elementary Linear Algebra by Larson and Edwards
\item Khan Academy's videos on multivariable calculus
\item Physics Stack Exchange has multiple relevant questions and answers on general relativity
\item Math Stack Exchange has multiple relevant questions and answers on calculus, linear algebra, and more
\end{enumerate}
