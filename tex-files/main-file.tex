\chapter{Calculus}
Calculus is the study of change. 
There are two main branches to calculus: differential and integral calculus. 
Differential calculus studies the slopes of lines, or the rate of change, using the derivative. 
Integral calculus studies the area under a curve. 
Many problems in many fields of science boil down to one of these two problems. 
Here, we will go over how to solve problems in the main fields of calculus, some applications of calculus, and finally some next steps in your study of calculus.

\end{enumerate}

\section{Differential}

Differential calculus is all about finding the slope of a curve. 
First, let's consider a normal case, finding the slope of a straight line. 
We take in two points, and find the change in x and change in y ($\Delta x$ and $\Delta y$). 
This can be written as $\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}$ or $\frac{\text{rise}}{\text{run}}$.

\begin{figure}[H]
\caption{Average Slope}
\includegraphics[scale=1]{../download.png}
\end{figure}

The above diagram illustrates this process on a curve. 
We pick two points on the line and find the average slope. 
However, this process is clearly not very accurate. 
Imagine that we move the two points closer and closer together. 
The closer the points are, the more accurate the slope is for that section of the line, until both points are on top of each other, and we have a line that touches our curve at one point.
That is, we are finding instantaneous slope.
The derivative does that for the whole line, taking in a function and giving a new function that represents the slope. 
For example, let's say we shoot a cannonball.

\begin{figure}[H]
\caption{Trajectory of cannonball}
\includegraphics[scale=1]{../imgres.png}
\end{figure}

Here, the y-axis represents the height of the cannonball in meters and the x-axis indicates time in seconds. 
Notice that at the beginning the slope is positive, until eventually the graph reaches its peak and the slope is zero, and then the graph starts going down and the slope becomes negative. 
The derivative of this graph would then look something like this:

\begin{figure}[H]
\caption{Derivative of trajectory of cannonball}
\includegraphics[scale=0.8]{../derivative.png}
\end{figure}

This is what is happening "behind the scenes" when we calculate derivatives.
However, it is important to note that, going back to the example of the cannonball, where the cannonball started does not affect the slope. 
If the whole graph is shifted up or down, the slope stays the same (as long as the proportions are kept the same). 
This, it turns out, is why we need to add the $c$ in a indefinite integral. 

Derivatives and integrals are inverses of each other. 
That is, they undo each other, like division undoes multiplication and subtraction undoes addition. 
So, because when going from an integral back to a derivative there is some uncertainty which graph you are looking at (parallel lines, for instance, have the same slope, but they have different "heights"), you have to add the $c$ when solving an indefinite integral.

Below is a table with some solutions to various derivatives. Note that $c$ is a constant and $n$ is non-zero. Note that the $'$ symbol is pronounced prime, and is another way to write that we are taking the derivative. 


\begin{tabular}{c|c}
    $f(x)$ & $\frac{df}{dx} = f'$\\
    \hline
       $7$  & $0$ \\
        $c$ & $0$ \\
        $x$ & $1$ \\
        $cx$ & $c$ \\
        $x^2$ & $2x$ \\
        $cx^2$ & $2cx$ \\
        $x^3$ & $3x^2$ \\
        $x^n$ & $nx^{n-1}$ \\
        $\sin x$ & $\cos x$ \\
        $\cos x$ & $-\sin x$ \\
        $- \sin x$ & $- \cos x$ \\
        $-\cos x$ & $\sin x$
\end{tabular}

Like integrals, derivatives are distributive over addition.
There are some interesting rules that make working with derivatives easier: the product rule, the quotient rule, and the chain rule. 

Let's start with the chain rule. 
If we have a function within a function in a derivative, like $\sin(\cos(x))$, we can assign a name to each function, like $g(x) = \cos(x)$ and $h(x) = \sin(x)$, and then follow this simple rule: $h'(g(x)) \cdot g'(x)$. 
So what does this mean? 
Well, let's plug it in. 
Plugging this in gives $\sin'(\cos(x)) \cdot \cos'(x)$. 
So the derivative of $\sin$ is $\cos$, so we write $\cos(\cos(x))$ for the first part, and the derivative of $\cos$ is $-\sin$, so we write $-\sin(x)$ for the second part. 
So now we have $\cos(\cos(x)) \cdot -\sin(x)$. 
This is the derivative of our original function.

Now, let's examine the product rule. 
If we have two functions, $u(x)$ and $v(x)$, and we want to take the derivative of $u\cdot v$, then we can do $u \cdot \frac{dv}{dx}+ v\cdot\frac{du}{dx}$. 
In other words, we multiply the first function by the derivative of the second function and then add the second function times the derivative of the first. 
For example, if we have $\sin(x)\cdot\cos(x)$ we would do $u(x) = \sin(x)$ and $v(x) = \cos(x)$. 
Then we would plug it in to our formula: $\sin(x)\cdot\frac{d}{dx}\cos(x) + \cos(x)\cdot\frac{d}{dx}\sin(x)$ which simplifies to $\sin\cdot -\sin(x) + \cos(x)\cdot\cos(x)$ or $-\sin^2(x)+\cos^2(x)$, which is our derivative of the original function.

Finally, the quotient rule. 
If we have two functions, $g(x)$ and $h(x)$, and we wish to take the derivative of $\frac{g(x)}{h(x)}$, we can follow the rule $\frac{g'(x)h(x)-h'(x)g(x)}{[h(x)]^2}$. 
While this may look rather complicated, it really isn't too bad. 
Let's use the example of $g(x) = \sin(x)$ and $h(x) = \cos(x)$. 
We plug it all in to get $\frac{\sin'(x)\cdot\cos(x) -\cos'(x)\cdot\sin(x)}{\cos^2(x)}$
which simplifies to $\frac{\cos(x)\cdot\cos(x)--\sin(x)\cdot\sin(x)}{\cos^2(x)} = \frac{\cos^2(x)+sin^2(x)}{\cos^2(x)} = \sin^2(x)$. 
So therefore, $\sin^2(x)$ is our derivative.

    \item $2t^4 - 13t$
    \item $x^{-1}$
    \item $\sqrt{x}$
\end{enumerate}

\section{Integral}

\input{integral.tex}

\section{Problems}
Solve the following integrals:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item $\int x \, dx$
    \item $\int x^2-5 \, dx$
    \item $\int^5_0 x^2 \, dx$
    \item $\int^5_3 x^2 \, dx$
    \item $\int^5_3 x^2 + 1 \, dx$
\end{enumerate}

\section{Applications}

Now we get to the most interesting part of calculus: its applications. 
Here, we are going to focus on only a few applications, but there are many applications of calculus, across many fields, such as economics, sociology, physics, mathematics itself, chemistry, astronomy, and others. 
Calculus is key in many fields.

The main application we are going to look at is work, as defined by physics. 
Interestingly, there is an integral definition of work - that is, work can be defined using an integral.

\begin{equation*}
    \int^b_a f(x) \, dx
\end{equation*}

What does this mean? 
Well, first, $f(x)$ is a function representing force, where $x$ is displacement, which, as Newton's second law states, is $F = ma$ - that is, force is mass times acceleration. 
Second, $b - a$ should equal the displacement, or how much the object is moved. This is because $b$ and $a$ are what we are substituting for $x$, which is displacement.
This is easier to illustrate with a few problems.

For example, let's say we have a bowling ball, rolled with a force equal to the function $f(x) = 2x+3$ (where the resulting number is in Newtons). 
We want to find out how much work it takes to roll it from the start of our lane down to the end of the lane, 10 meters away.

Well, here, this is easy. All we do is plug in the numbers into our formula for work! 

\begin{equation*}
    \int^{10}_0 2x+3 \, dx
\end{equation*}

Remember that $a$ and $b$ together represent displacement. 
We're rolling the bowling ball from the start, $0$, to the end of the lane, $10$ meters away. 
So that represents $a$ and $b$ respectively. 
The force, $f(x)$, is simple to plug in. 
So now, we follow the rules for integrating. 
In this case, we get $2\frac{x^2}{2}+3x\mid^{10}_0$. 
Note that this last part, the line with the superscripts, is just a bit of notation, saying that we plug in $10$ and $0$ and subtract according to the rules of definite integrals. 
It just allows us to integrate and write that down. 

So now that we have this, we plug it in as we would for normal definite integrals, and so we get $(2\cdot\frac{10^2}{2}+3\cdot 10) - (2\cdot\frac{0^2}{2}+3\cdot 0)$ and then we simplify. 
The whole second half comes to zero, so we now have $2\cdot\frac{10^2}{2}+3\cdot 10$. 
Then, we have $2\cdot \frac{100}{2}+ 30$ or $2\cdot 50 + 30$ or $130$. 
Now we look at units. 
We have meters and newtons, so now when we multiply those two, we have joules (a unit of work). 
So our answer is $130$ joules. 
Note that it is very important to keep track of your units. If you don't know a unit of force, work, or distance, look it up! Think logically.

A quick note on Hooke's Law: when considering the work required to stretch a spring, you can assume that the force ($f(x)$) needed to stretch a spring a distance $x$ beyond its natural length is proportional to $x$. 
In other words, we have $f(x) = cx$ where $x$ is the distance the spring is stretched and $c$ is some constant.

\section{Problems}
For the second problem, the spring can be assumed to obey Hooke's Law.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item If throwing a baseball requires a force equivalent to $f(x) = 5x^2$ pounds then find the work necessary to throw a baseball from third to first base (about $127$ feet).
    \item If a ten-pound force stretches an elastic spring one inch, how much work is done in stretching the spring one foot?
\end{enumerate}

\section{What Next?}

What we've been looking at here is called single variable calculus - which, clearly enough, involves integrals and derivatives with only one variable. 
However, there is such a thing as multivariable calculus, adding more variables, and even more usefulness to an already incredibly useful tool. 
This is a good next thing to study after single-variable calculus. 
There is also a form of calculus called vector calculus (to study this, it is a good idea to know
linear algebra) which is useful to know. 
Finally, there is the field of differential equations, from simpler, "ordinary" differential equations to more complex partial differential equations. 
All of these fields are incredibly interesting and well worth studying.
